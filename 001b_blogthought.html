Greetings.
<br><br>
In light of the fact that, finally, I am making good on my promise that there would be a deadline to the 001b side of things, I am making this post. Soon, I shall accept nothing more. It has been interesting, if nothing else; although, I admit that I have not found the time, nor the passion, to delve into the puzzle side of things with the submissions. That shouldn’t be too surprising to many of you, since you know that I am not really a puzzle sort, despite what some may tell you about how complex some stupid binary shit “ACTUALLY” is. Hahaha. Still, there are a lot of cool things included in the easier to access pages, and I am happy to see what has been created there. 
<br><br>
I underestimated just how complicated most people found the process of making a single page. Making a single image was impossible for some, and creating several? It drove people to the depths of insanity… And so, only the truly dedicated ever emerged to offer themselves to this cause and accept this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. This is probably why what I envisioned, a collab terminal where everyone made a page or two and then combined it into one terminal, never happened. The hurdle of creation, to make the time, was too great for too many, (even taking into account all of the accounts which were cast out for the great offense of impassiveness.) And while I overestimated the capabilities and passions of many, in the same motion I underestimated the few who did take up the mantle to fill out the 001b void. 
<br><br>
The only real downside is that now people think that I created all of the community submissions in the clearly marked area where it’s a collab with different collaborators having different areas… Which isn’t anyone’s fault but the people who miss this obvious fact.
<br><br>
The final day should reveal even more worthwhile creations, and so I look forward to that.
<br><br>
Putting aside this matter, I would like to say that I currently don’t have a good idea where I should put the link to this one page. I was thinking that maybe just the Assistance page would do, but maybe there’s an even better place than that. Within Books is one idea, but I’d rather not distract from what’s there if I can help it. With that being said, let me link it <a href="Ariph.html" STYLE="TEXT-DECORATION: NONE">here</a>.
<br>---<br>
If you’ve read this far, thank you. I didn’t say everything I wanted to, but that’s fine. 
As long as you’re not skimming through, you should be able to notice that if you look into the source code of this page I have left a link to my discord server in there. It will only be for a limited time, perhaps so limited that you won’t even have the chance to use it, but that’s not really my problem. 
		 <br><br>Anyway, have a good day. Or don’t.
