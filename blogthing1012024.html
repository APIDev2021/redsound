Greetings! It has been some time, hasn’t it?
<br><br>
I’ve been writing the next book, (World’s End), for a few months now, but as some of you have seen, I’ve been making a few YouTube videos here and there as of late. There are THREE reasons why I’m doing so, but the only ONE that I can tell you is that “I needed a small break from the current writing progress point to see it with eyes anew.” (This is because I have two things to conjoin in a special way and I’ve reread both multiple times and I know that I need the SPACE to step back and reconsider my pacing. (There is more to it than that, but I won’t be able to delve into that until I’ve published this book, unless I die and then I’m kinda fucked in respects to elucidating this point.)) …the other reasons are just as compelling, but I’m not able to tell you at this point in time. And I’m being serious about this. In the future, you might be able to see why, but at that point would you even remember to consider this?<br><br>
I also doubt that I’ll go out of my way to tell you… Oh well. That’s just how it goes sometimes!<br><br>
What I will say, however, is that you will thank me for withholding my other motives. As ever, surprises are all the better if they truly “surprise”. Anyone remember [redacted]? Or the Summer Special??? <br><br>*Ahem.* That’s what I THOUGHT, BITCH!
<br><br>
On the YouTube front, I am working like a retarded ADHD worm on the “question video” at this current point in time. I also have a few smaller ideas stored away for later use, mainly in regards to my 3dio ASMR stuff. The funnier ideas haven’t been acted upon, and I’d like to do those, but also, I would need to ensure that I don’t destroy MORE VR equipment, my living space (which, if you’re lucky enough, becomes your dying space!!!), and the peace of everyone sleeping around me in this apartment while creating said videos. Additionally, I haven’t had that much time off from work as of late, so that has been a big bummer, (even if I understand that it could be much worse. (I could be French.(Or a French VTuber!!!!!))) I rather enjoy videos I have to put 0 editing effort into, and ones that require an entire backstory/document to align are not amongst the chosen few I enjoy. Also, one of the funnier ideas requires me to be loud, but the ASMR only works when no one is awake… Maybe a weekend riiiight b4 my GF wakes up is something that can work for that, but that’s kind of a hard sell for the laziest bastard in the Supercluster.
<br><br>
I do enjoy using my VR gear for more than just Gatherings, (although those are really fun*** as well!!), and the inclusion of it in this format does my heart good. Ah, yes, these hundreds upon hundreds of dollars can ACTUALLY be put to good use! (*winking face while also crying and also shaking uncontrollably.*)
<br><br>
Moving on from my current actions, (which will surely return to writing soonTM), I wanted to express my genuine concern that the majority of you do not take our cause seriously. But I’m not going to get deep into it at present. I just wanted to express that feeling on a surface level basis. No matter the reasons “why”, this failure is ultimately mine to bear.
<br><br>
Well then, with that out of the way, I’ll leave you with your own thoughts, and this handy little link for any fresh meat that is coherent enough to understand what I mean by this. (((((((((((((((((((((((<!--https://discord.gg/d82qV9XEqa-->(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((

***but it takes pain to make bliss, and I feel pretty blissfully;;;… : }
