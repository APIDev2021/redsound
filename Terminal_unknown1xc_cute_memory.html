	  Of course, I know what it is now that I’ve left that place, but, at the time, I couldn’t recall what it was that was missing there. What I myself missed so dearly… Indeed, the concept itself was lost in the darkness. What was it? I asked myself repeatedly, trying to find the answer somewhere from within. But there was no light there either.<br><br>
Yes, in that place, I had forgotten what light was.<br><br>
No light shone over me, no light crept up from below me through some strange crack, and no light survived within me; for I was no longer in darkness: I was one with it. There was not a speck of light in that place. Or, at least, there wasn’t any that I could see. Despite being “blind” without it, being bereft of its guidance seemed, in and of itself, to be a form of guidance. My lack of sight led me towards visions of something “like” light, (but after careful considerations it certainly wasn’t light in any sense of the word.) It was darker than light, brighter than darkness, but far less real.<br><br>
I admit that it’s a strange thing to say. Of course, if it wasn’t real and I could see it without light, then it must have just been my imagination. That’s what I thought at first as well. Another thought was that some other system in my body was replacing my sense of sight in a sorry attempt to fill the void within my mind.<br><br>
Though these ideas did not last long.<br><br>
Floating in the dark, wading through shadows, plunging into the deep…<br><br>
Somewhere in that abyss, I saw it; and it was, (as they sometimes say), “oh-so-cute”. (So much so that there was no way I could have thought of it myself. I mean, really, if you had seen it, then you would have easily agreed with me that there was not a chance in all of reality that I would have been able to think of such a thing in those darkest of depths. (Not that I couldn’t think of anything, but I was mostly thinking about where Fyuumu had gone and where that voice was leading me.))<br><br>
Anyway, these pulses of that “non-light” passed through me, and that’s how I saw it. And what I saw could only be described as cute! Well, if I were to shorten it down to one word, that is. Truthfully, there was a lot to see in the moments when this non-light dragged itself along the nothingness and through me; there were even stars! The warmth of a strange smelling liquid pouring from one vessel into another, the sounds of pages being turned and flipped, of books being stacked!<br><br>
Ah, there were so many wonderful things within those patterns…<br><br>
But none of that is what was so cute.<br><br>
The creature staring back at me through the fluctuating, shifting visions, (if you could even call them that!), well, that creature possessed the most beautifully colored eyes that I had ever beheld! The most precious of colors, imagine that as an eye-color. Ah, but that wasn’t all. No, in fact, there’s no such thing as “the most precious color in the world”. Nor “the greatest!” As it turns out, there are two great colors of this world.<br><br>
And that creature, staring at me, (or perhaps through me), possessed both of those unbelievable colors. One for each eye. Shimmering, twinkling, and swirling with wisdom. Its intelligence seemed to be piercing through me as I marveled at those eyes! But could you blame me? Who would believe it? How can one being have two eyes like that? In those moments, I thought that maybe it had stolen at least one of those colors from someone else. A theft must have taken place, because no single thing should be allowed to be that cute.<br><br>
And as I thought that, the patterns of strangeness finished their passage through me.<br><br>
Just like that, it was all gone.<br><br>
But I couldn’t just forget. I hadn’t “seen” it, but I had “something’d” it. If you understand, (though if you don’t actually understand don’t feel bad because I’m still currently trying to formulate a proper scientific explanation of what took place there, but, honestly, I don’t think it’s possible for that to happen because, scientifically, nothing is supposed to be that cute anyway. So, the reality is likely to be something outside of my reality, (and, if you would, an example of this would be that, (perhaps!), this is all a dream.))<br><br>
Not convincing, I know. And yet, from this singular, momentary encounter, something profound was left behind within me. This feeling of adoration for the creature with those beaming, ageless eyes…<br><br>
Ah! Of course, I had to adorn my display with something like it. Although, I admit that the colors I had “not seen” that “day??” cannot be replicated here. It might be that replication is impossible since the color is reflective of what lies within that creature’s own body. And so, I cannot get any closer to it through such means.<br><br>
But I haven’t forgotten that day. I simply can’t.<br><br>
To be cute, to become closer with what Fyuumu was so that I never forget…<br><br>
It can’t be a coincidence. That creature was a higher being than I. It was so attractive that even if I only replicate a percentage of its appeal, I daresay that I will become inseparable from Fyuumu. The cuteness I’ll gain will impart insights which will keep us together forever.
Ah… to be cute, to never forget our treasure, to never forget ourselves!
