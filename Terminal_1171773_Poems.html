<div align="center">

	<div class="gg"><ul><li><font color="#c1b492">
Standing here, reaching out.<br>
I try to run, want to shout.<br><br>

But there’s no escape, no way to win—<br>
As all our miseries, lay within.<br><br>

Deeper still, there is no “I”.<br>
And up above, there is no sky.<br><br>

Distinctions shackle, dimensions bind. <br>
Reality: a fractured figment of the mind.<br><br>

What is, was, and was is were.<br>
And the you that is us, stretches, spins—<br>
Becoming oh-so-ablur.<br><br>

And so, the thing we are continues to turn.<br>
Replacing heat with a ruinous spurn.<br><br>

	

		</font>
	</ul></div>
	<div class="gg2"><ul><li><font color="#c1b492">
Set down by a susurrating, metal sarcophagus,<br>
we set off with Lances in hand.<br>
Chanting, our voices echo: unmolested<br>
Marching, our footsteps go: uncontested.<br><br>

This warped place, its writhing landscape and rotten seams—<br>
is but a festering, fetid dream.<br>
And nothing, brothers, is as it seems.<br><br>

Marching across a tether, altogether,<br>
As—<br>
—Forces unseen claim their toll.<br>
Hopes, bones, and each tempered will:<br>
are rendered nil.<br><br>

We are cast like stones, plunged into unknown depths.<br>
Will we share the same watery grave? <br>
Or am I alone to be spared, freed from sharing in your deaths?<br>
Your all, into this heart, shall I engrave.<br><br>

O’ brothers, this sentence:<br>
You never deserved.<br><br>


Floating down an endless reflection,<br>
engulfed in this infection.<br>
Lapped by ripples, distortions, that run deep.<br>
The passage of time: pointless,<br>
When swallowed up by such grief.<br><br>

Then, from the muddied void:<br>
strange harbingers emerge.<br>
Their many faces: shadowed and perfectly ovoid.<br>
A veritable myriad of maleficent demiurge.<br><br>

Ah, and when their voices join as one,<br>
A reverberating tone shakes this place<br>
Their lunatic song, O’ how it has twisted this space.<br>
This endless river, now spirals upward.<br><br>

If your dreams still exist, <br>
then let them ring true, brothers.<br>
For I am going now,<br>
To the fields of flesh and bone.<br>
Where Unnce waits, upon his accursed throne.<br><br>

	<div class="gg3"><ul><li><font color="#c1b492">
Thin lines,<br>
intersecting at a curvature,<br>
caressed by soft unknowns.<br>
From afar their turns are perfect,<br>
warm, and inviting:<br>
a perfect place to lay your tired head.<br><br>

These thin lines,<br>
If they were to be chipped at,<br>
would their true colors show?<br>
A faded shade of gold?<br>
Some faint wisp of former glory. Days long gone.<br>
Or a deeply burning scarlet? Too bright for unassuming eyes.<br>
Perhaps you would find, no color at all.<br>
Eroded and wiped away, no trace to be discerned.<br>
Like that peeling paint, that slowly descends,<br>
downward, off that plastered wall.<br><br>

Regardless of the three dimensions<br>
The fourth still holds all three at bay.<br>
Arbiter, and high judicator, it<br>
contorts binding pacts to show the folly<br>
of coveting those lines<br>
who intersect so succinctly<br>
behind the knee, and atop lips.<br><br>

Slabs of steel come down, as mechanical arms begin hissing. <br>

“That’s safe enough, but isn’t something missing?”<br>

Seals begin whirring. “Well, I do believe the whole system is concurring…”<br>

Locks interlace with additional plates of metal. And, eventually, settle.<br>

Fail-safes sputter online.<br>

“And now, it’s time to pour some wine.”

we’re as happy as can be,<br>
I’ve got you, and you’ve got me,<br>

you know, it seems like forever since we started walking<br>
and since then, we’ve travelled o’er both land and sea<br><br>

always together: you, and me<br><br>

but it took a few years to really get to talkin’<br>
and by then our talk had turned to the topic of stopping…<br><br>

though really, there’s no need to fuss,<br>
our fate had simply caught up with us<br><br>


oh but we’re as happy as can be,<br>
you know I’d shoot you, and you’d shoot me<br><br>


though the end is drawing near, don’t you ever fret my dear, <br>
cuz I’ll just whisper sweet words in your ear,<br><br>

and out the other, the bullet flies, <br>
I guess you’re the “second to last” who dies<br><br>

but no matter, ‘this or that’, <br>
you’re still number one to me<br><br>

yes no matter if we live or die, <br>
I’ve got you, and you’ve got me,<br><br>

and we’ll be as happy as corpses can be<br>
ah… <br>
most definitely…

	<div class="gg6"><ul><li><font color="#c1b492">
You are but an illusion,<br>

And nothing you see is real.<br>

So walk hand in hand with delusion,<br>

And let your dreams congeal.

	<div class="gg7"><ul><li><font color="#c1b492">

I can’t move my body, can’t turn my head. Without yet knowing, I’m so full of dread.<br><br>

I can’t see much, but my whole room is changing and— arranging. The walls shift, giving way to a rift. Seeping, streaking, and streaming, it runs and rolls, pooling upon the floor: dark and deep. <br><br>

With this, I know: I won’t be getting any sleep.<br><br>

Now I can feel it, inside my chest. It’s coming for me, and it knows what’s best.<br><br>

The lights return, but are orange just like the rest. Everything is rust. My every breath is full of dampened metal, reeking of must, and dust.<br><br>

Decay rains on my bed, as the ceiling rots away. And suddenly, I start to allay…<br><br>

I know that the good doctor is coming. Ah, the Rust Doctor, he’s coming for me. <br><br>

To set things right, as all things should be.
