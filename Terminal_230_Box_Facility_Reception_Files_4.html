Dating far past the creation of the BPF, there were worm myths. That there are some during this present day, and present time, is of no surprise. And it does not end with mere myths and stories, many entities create shrines dedicated to these worms out of reverence and respect. They are, after all, thought of as “holy” creatures by many. <br><br>

This is the one common thread amongst all worm myths. They are either directly gods themselves, or related to gods through some divine bloodline. Or, perhaps, they are a force of “nature”, a force for good, and creating beauty wherever they slither, or crawl, or float… or however worms truly move.
<br><br>
It is likely that one myth in particular, “The Hundred-Eyed Worm”, has done the most for furthering this idea. It’s one of the oldest stories around, and has clear “godly” imagery relating to worms and their kind, (especially the worm with a hundred eyes, who is quite impressive, even if we don’t think worms are really that impressive here at the BPF, it’s actually impressive to read about this spooky worm), anyway…
<br><br>
It might be that this story was actually true. As strange as that may seem, stories and myths like these are sometimes used to relay information that would otherwise be difficult to explain. So, perhaps, back in those times… maybe there really was a godly “worm”. 
<br><br>
Still, it doesn’t change the fact that these worms we encounter outside of the BPF might not even be related to this godly thing, that this godly worm might have been godly, but not a worm, and it certainly doesn’t mean that these worms here are in any way supernatural nor godly, even if they were related to a god worm.
<br><br>
Still, it is worth thinking about. There’s a lot to read about, but this isn’t the time to get into the specific details of each and every myth. No, this is just to give you a taste. There are further records, but you must be given clearance to read them.
<br><br>
However, most of it is [REDACTED].
