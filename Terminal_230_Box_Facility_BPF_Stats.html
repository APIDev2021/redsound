	On this page, you will find general statistics and facts relating to the BPF! <br><br>
<li><li>
“BPF” stands for “Box Production Facility”, and our mission is to box everything that needs boxing, and to create any box required to box all of these things! As we say, we’ll box it all!<br><br>

On average, a total of 901,523,024,339.62 boxes are produced and shipped by the BPF every single day! <br><br>

The BPF was founded 403-250i602=3040234m3 3=24n3240-fv903n=03i429d032n20=3oj4 and 404023n30572104—299405 cycles ago. <br><br>

Every single worker in the BPF was created to work at the BPF. The reason for this is that each worker can be crafted with care, just like our boxes! To gain freedom from the costs of creating them, they can work at the BPF! But, because working at the BPF is so fun, they never want to leave! This is a problem that only the BPF faces, as elsewhere, not every worker loves their job.<br><br>

The BPF has been given the blessing of the Speaker of Terminal 230. <br><br>

Most headaches aren’t reduced by time nor taking “medication”. Instead, the BPF sends boxes filled with special “headache suppression teams” into any headache afflicted entity. This is why any Terminal nearby 230 has the added bonus of being free of any headaches, since the lag-time between sending box requests and receiving them is so low.<br><br>

“Headache suppression teams” do not take prisoners. They shoot to kill (your headaches, that is).<br><br>

Boxes were chosen as the production shape of choice because of how stable they are. Others may focus on other shapes, but they are unreliable and of lesser quality than a hand-crafted and lovingly constructed box.<br><br>



Every second, 500 boxes are recycled by the BPF and used to create new and improved box materials.<br><br>

There have been zero confirmed sightings of worms within the BPF!<br><br>

It has been said that even your heart is box shaped.<br><br>

There’s no other facility quite like the BPF within the Terminal supercluster. There are other container production facilities, but there isn’t a single one which is as productive as us. Also, we are the only facility which focuses on a single container type. Our motto is “quality, over quantity!”<br><br>

The BPF, and Terminal 230 as a whole, is the only place which is governed, (in part), by the BENEFACTORS. They have no influence over any other Terminal, even if their efforts benefit many other Terminals, same as the efforts as the BPF.<br><br>

Over 96% of BPF customers are satisfied with their orders.<br><br>

The BPF has a 101% uptime rating, and a SS-25 quality rating. Compared to the next best container facility, we are, at our worst, 80% better than them! This is an accomplishment which would not be possible without the efforts from everyone, including you.<br><br>

Around 30% of boxes are consumed on site by their recipients. Another 15% are recycled on site.<br><br>

Currently, the BPF consumes about 3,005,096,383,293,364,842,058,732 box units of energy per “day”. Despite this vast consumption of energy, the BPF produces at least 300 times this amount of energy per day.<br><br>

EXUBERANT BIMA loves the BPF.<br><br>
 
The BPF anthem lyrics were written by the BENFACTORS during the first days of the BPF’s creation as an initiative to increase everyone’s boxing spirit. Looking back at the data, we can now say that this anthem increased everyone’s boxing spirits, (and happiness), by at least 25%.<br><br>

There are no issues with the suggestion box.<br><br>

At any given moment, there are, on average, 483,305,302 active orders, and 303,204 pending orders. To keep up such high demand, the BPF utilizes highly advanced “auto forge” technology and even more advanced “portal” technologies to fulfill all orders, big or small.<br><br>

Guests are only able to see around 10% of the BPF. The rest are kept “off-limits” to ensure guest safety.
