This document is a non-technical and simplified explanation of how signals from beyond the Terminals are captured and processed, along with other bits of information. Additional clearances and permissions are required to access more detailed information regarding these processes. (If you possess these permissions, please submit an application to 45-N-54-xW-114-btE26 and wait approximately 1 cycle for a response. If you are accepted, then you will be transported to the appropriate area where this information is held.)

<font size="+2">Introduction</font><br><li><br>
		
It is common knowledge how the Terminals came to be, and how the arrays of eyes were traded for the structure we now reside within today. However, for all of the peering that the original eye arrays did, they were not receiving “signals” from beyond this space.
<br><br>
What they did was peer into spaces and take what they could through piercing stares. This was useful, but it had its limitations. After all, you can only learn so much by observing from afar. With more eyes, came more clarity, but by the time more eyes were grown, the opportunity for viewing was gone. And, most importantly, none of this information was coming from nearby. None of it was meant for us, and none of it was a message meant to relay some meaning.
<br><br>
These facts are why new systems meant for listening in on the vast void around the Terminal arrays were built shortly after the last of the eye arrays were reabsorbed.

<font size="+2">Signals</font><br><li><br>
	
It is a common misconception that almost nothing reaches the Terminals through the void/space/Abyss which surrounds us. In reality, the Terminals are constantly bombarded by signals and energies and all sorts of things such as these at all times. Why then, is it said that nothing reaches us? Well, this is because nearly all of this “information” crashing into us is actually noise and interference created, at least in part, by the CoS. There’s a lot to be said regarding this interaction, and what our current understanding of the outside spaces are, but this is information which is best left to the experts. (For example, there is an indiscernible pattern through which this interference seems to distort and destroy true signals and real information in several alternating ways. Attempting to forecast future distortions to best capture signals is an important endeavor.) But, all in all, you only need to know is that this “snow and noise” and “ash and interference” which is coming at us from all directions makes picking up anything of worth exceedingly difficult. 
<br><br>
Unbelievably, it’s as if universes are being born right beside us at all times. (In regards to the extreme amounts of noise and interference produced.) Of course, even if they were being created beside us, they would be consumed by the CoS before their interference would reach us. Although, these distortions persist…

As said before, more detailed texts involving these points are reserved for entities with higher permissions.

<font size="+2">After Capture</font><br><li><br>

After a potential message / signal has been captured by the proper equipment, it is subjected to countless differing passes of varying levels and complexities. The original data is copied, and after the first round of passes are done, the resulting information is manually sifted through. After this point, the most promising sets of data are then run through even more passes to refine the relevant data and remove any lingering noise from the message. After this is done, the message is translated, so even probes can read it.<br><br>

Periodically, older sets of data are subjected to tests and put through passes to determine if more data can be squeezed out of it. However, this is done only when resources allow for it. Priority is always given to signals which have been newly captured.

It is worth noting that even after careful parsing of data, over 83% of all messages are entirely unusable, and most of what is “usable” is only usable in the sense that it can tell us how to correctly pick apart other signals. <br><br>

An estimated .05% of all captured signals were reconstructed using these methods.
