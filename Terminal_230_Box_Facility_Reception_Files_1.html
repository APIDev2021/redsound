Indeed, depending upon the arrangement of the micro-lattices within the panels which constitute the box, it can vary greatly from the energy state of the surrounding area. With enough careful consideration, it is possible to create small “portals” wherein more space can be accessed within the physical constraints of the physical box. <br><br>

In this way, capacity can be improved, while maintaining the box’s shape and size, without compromise.<br><br>

However, studies into box energies have less to do with improving current box technologies, but instead to mitigate the risks associated with these energies.
<br><br>
For example, a standard box, even with careful refinement and attunement at the smallest of scales, can still have unpredictable energies within itself, while also displaying characteristics which we ourselves would build it to display. That is to say, it would work as intended, until other factors are introduced.
<br><br>
One such factor would be other boxes. Indeed, the energies within a box can, and will, project into other boxes, depending upon the size of the box and its overall micro-structure attunement, or lack thereof. So, this is a constant factor when dealing with the energy concerns with any given box.
<br><br>
It is possible, however, to look at the box energy / aura problem on a greater scale: by either treating a group of boxes as one giant, nebulous box, or by only grouping together exact box copies to mitigate this factor, it is possible to further model the box energy phenomenon.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, this line of research has led to a further box energy discovery: boxes aren’t really boxes. That is, their auras reach out into further dimensions and give them properties that are impossible for a box to have. This is how they’re able to link up with other boxes, and this is why box groups can link up with other box groups. 
<br><br>
In fact, in every study conducted thus far, it has been found that there is no distance that will break the energy “bond” of boxes. No matter where they are, they are connected through this strange phenomenon.
<br><br>
It has been suggested that it might be because of the [REDACTED] production that these energies exist, but it has not been proven thus far.
<br><br>
Further research is required to mitigate the energy risks. These energies are likely the cause of boxes spontaneously teleporting, exploding, and learning their own language. However, since the phenomenon is mired in so much mystery, it can’t be said for certain that it is the main cause, if even the only cause of these incidents. <br><br>
