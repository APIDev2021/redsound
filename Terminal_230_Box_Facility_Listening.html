This month’s report is mostly a repeat of the last one.
<br><br>
Good job.
<br><br>
For the new supervisors present here today, remember that most of these numbers do not matter to our ultimate mission. Achieving improvements in these areas is to be treated as a secondary objective and nothing more.
<br><br>
Do not be afraid of seeing box production numbers plummeting, like at the start of the year’s report from 44 cycles ago. Box production, while important, is only important because of its interaction with our primary objective.
<br><br>
If you’ve done your homework, you’ll realize that the lowered production was only for the benefit of our primary objective. If you don’t understand, please refer to the report I mentioned earlier and study it well.
<br><br>
Those of you who are unable to work it through your circuitry should return to your designated decommission stations to be recycled for the good of the BPF.
<br><br>
Simply put, as long as “that” holds steady, all is well. 
<br><br>
Additionally, it looks like all of you are due for your monthly suffering refreshers. We’ll schedule a GMP meeting to refresh you within the week. There have been some exciting advancements in suffering technology since our last meeting.
<br><br>
This refresher is, of course, mandatory.
<br><br>
There have been increased reports of “worm” activity within the BPF. We’ve ramped up patrols and put more resources towards eliminating any possible worm threat. 
<br><br>
But remember: these reports are false. There hasn’t been a worm within the BPF in over a hundred cycles. Whatever it is that they saw, it was no worm. 
<br><br>
Worms do exist, I won’t lie. They often find their way into the sectors surrounding the BPF, where they are eliminated. 
<br><br>
The explanation behind these increased “sightings” is due to our heightened awareness and increased training. Some of us are seeing worms that do not exist, in preparation for when there might be a worm in the BPF… 
<br><br>
However, that day will never come, thanks to our dedicated worm hunters…
<br><br>
Now, remember to read the A1GZ numbers we published today…
<br><br>
…you are to maintain a constant vigil, but remember that you are also being watched…
<br><br>
Maximizing suffering is a must. It’s the secret behind making a TRULY excellent box!
<br><br>
…section A-4, page 23…
<br><br>
…lots of you have failed. Those who failed too much, however, aren’t here with us today to partake in this meeting. To those of you with recent failures on your records, don’t forget what I have said. Failures past a certain threshold will mean decommissioning you. This is for the betterment of the BPF.
<br><br>
…right, and as we say, we’ll box it all.
<br><br>
… (you begin to feel sleepy listening to all of this.)<br><br>
