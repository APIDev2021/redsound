She’s not herself anymore. She’s not what she used to be. <br><br>
And she’s gone. I had her. Yes, she was here with me. But then, without warning, she left. But how?! How could she leave? <br><br>
She’s not alive. <br><br>
But that was before. And now, she’s alive. She can move. And first thing she did was leave me. As soon as she could move, she ripped herself from my arms. But… she’s moving. That means that… Yes, it means that she isn’t herself anymore. So, it wasn’t really her that left me. No, she wouldn’t, because she couldn’t. <br><br><br><br>

And what about I? <br><br>
Is the same thing happening to me? <br><br>
Is that how I let her slip from my grasp?<br><br>
Am I changing too? <br><br>
Or, has it already happened?<br><br>
Ah…<br><br><br><br>

Into the dark, like it was just a black liquid.<br><br>
She swam away. Back and forth. Undulate. <br><br>
Sine wave. Locomotion, moving, moving…<br><br>
She slipped into shadows, worming. Getting smaller, smaller, smaller…<br><br>
A warped perspective, almost no light. Yes… she had gone from me just like that.<br><br>
…just like that.<br><br><br><br>

Please, someone bring her back to me. I cannot see without her in this dark, and there’s no point in continuing without her. So, I’ll say it as many times as I have to.<br><br><br><br>

Please, bring her back…<br><br><br><br>


I pray to you, the unending dark, give her back. She swam into you but to you she does not belong. You know this, and if you do not, I will tell this to you until you do. If you can, push her back towards me. And I know you can do at least that, for you are pushing me and pushing me and tossing me farther and farther towards the bottom of this abyssal hell! <br><br>
I do not wish to be in your center! I do not wish to be anywhere without her! Give her back. AT ONCE.<br><br>
Ah… but if that will not work, if these prayers are too light for you, then let me call upon the stars instead. Yes, the stars. Those illusory things hold more light than you do, so I’ll call to them. I’ll ask them to give her back.<br><br>
Stars above, you small, flickering part in this world’s order, I pray that you can reunite us. No matter the cost, I’ll pay it. If you are able to bring her back, I shall do whatever you ask of me. Yes, even if I die, that would be fine with me. Just help me in this moment. Listen to my plea. Return her to my side, so that I can finally see.<br><br>
Stars… help.<br><br>
Help. Help. Help. HELP.<br><br>
HELP ME FIND HER.<br><br>
At least shine your light here! <br><br>
There’s nothing here for me to see without your guidance. There’s no light! Nothing!<br><br>
Though you are only a memory here in this place, I can still feel your presence up above. I know that you can hear me. You are a part of something grand. You could solve this problem with a twinkle, just one wink!<br><br><br><br>

And so I pray… Please, save us. <br><br>
Ah…<br><br><br><br>

No one is coming to save us. Nothing will listen. <br><br>
I’m starting to forget why they won’t save us.<br><br>
Who we even are.<br><br>
Stars… what are you?<br><br>
…<br><br><br><br>
Where am I?<br><br>
I’m choking. There’s water coming out of my face.<br><br>
It’s wet. <br><br>
It’s dark.<br><br><br><br>

Is… this why I need help?<br><br>
I need to… remember.<br><br>
I need help, to remember. <br><br>
Stars… please, help me remember. Please…<br><br><br><br>

Starsss, ssstatic, ah…<br><br>
The dark is like static. Noise.<br><br>
Am I not real? Oh ssstars…. . . .p  l e eease.<br><br>
H elp me, fromthis isisi istaticcc<br><br><br><br>
