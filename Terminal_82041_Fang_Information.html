	Fangs. Everyone wants them. But most don’t actually need them. <br>
But what are they? What do they do? How do you get some? These are all important questions, and this page was created to give you the cold, hard FACTS so that you can understand this all for yourself. That’s right, no propaganda here. Just the facts, all the time.<br>
Now, let’s begin.<br><br>

Fangs are specialized teeth which are used, in most cases, to assist with the consumption of flesh. Their origins are strange, but it is true that they were first donned by mindless beasts who had no idea as to the true potential of these fangs.<br><br>

Fangs are characterized by their large size, and their shape, which tapers off into a very sharp point. This shape assists with stabbing and tearing into things, but it also causes these specialized teeth to be quite susceptible to breakage, since the shape which creates this magnificent point is weaker than other teeth configurations.<br><br>

However, fangs are fangs, but they aren’t JUST fangs. When placed in the mouth of something cute… they can make their host EVEN CUTER. Why? How? It’s actually still a mystery. For example, not all entities are moved by the appearance of a fang emerging from a smile.<br><br>

There are many theories to explain this phenomenon, and why it doesn’t work if the host isn’t already cute and things such as this… but we’re not here to discuss the leading ideas proposed today.<br><br>

We’re here to give you the facts.<br><br>

When conditions are correct, some fangs can cut the [THREADS]. Now, this is pretty serious. It could destroy reality in a given area, and destabilize time, for example. However, this is quite rare, and it has only been observed once before. Though it is something to keep in mind. It is thought that fangs such as these are sharp not only physically, but they are sharp throughout multiple dimensions of being.<br><br>
There are several different types of fangs. The main one is one that is a type of tooth. The other type, which is almost as prevalent as one made of toothy materials, is one made of flesh. This “flesh tooth” sometimes has the power to appear as an actual toothy fang when observed closely, though it always reverts back into a fleshy thing once the closer observation is ceased.<br><br>

Both main types of fangs, (and all sub-types), increase a cute host’s cute appeal by over 245%.<br><br>

Fangs can emit beams of light if they are charged correctly.<br><br>

Some fangs grow within the skull. These are the types that can harm [THREADS]. However, the process of growing them will usually kill their host before they can be of any threat to reality. Also, these types of fangs are anomalous in the sense that they do not increase the cuteness of their host. The only theory relating to this is that fangs that do increase cuteness are ones that are revealed in a smile, and it is this relationship which gives them the property of being cute.<br><br>

The cutest of beings will flash their fangs at you in an attempt to win your heart over. If you are susceptible to fangs, you will not be able to resist this display. But be warned, it’s not all cuteness and cute stuff. Prolonged exposure to these fang displays can be deadly to those with weak bodies. Your bodily functions will be overworked from attempting to continually process the cute values in front of you, and you may die. Thus, it is important to keep exposure down to a healthy level… even if they are reeaaaallly cute.<br><br>

There are many things that are said to go straight through “someone’s heart”, (in a love related way), but there is none more powerful than a cute fang. FACT.<br><br>
