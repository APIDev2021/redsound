Enveloped and integrated into this fog-like mass of phantasms, the sun and the stars were nearly extinguished; their lights were made vague and without direction.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lost in this fog, same as I.</span></p>

Yet even this would not last: ever-so-slowly, ever-so-slightly, and oh-so-peacefully, it was getting colder, darker. Everything was slipping, inching towards the edge of that fateful precipice: yet another Fold.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>And so, the threads were taken: lives, cut short.</span></p>

And without delay. But that would be a difficult task, (disregarding the fact that the substance was of <em>Aveyas</em> and so was everywhere and nowhere all at once), since my form had been faltering for quite some time now. Each step was another too far, as these swelling, purple knees of mine tried to keep from buckling; though my bruised body was a testament to their failure, which was also mine.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>It hurt to think about how even the simple act of breathing had started to pain me. And though I had never experienced it firsthand, this felt suspiciously like I was&hellip;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;line-height:135%;'><em><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>Dying.</span></em></p>

Gazing upon her delicate form once again, I felt emotions which were deeper than sadness, more complicated than grief. Her bright eyes, the perfect curvature of her smile that persisted despite our situation: that loveliness which could not be dulled by dirt nor blood, that which defied my cold analysis. That smile&hellip; It made me feel warm, and though it certainly did not warm me in truth, it truly did heal something <em>within</em> me. I felt a modicum lighter, as if she took a misery from my heart and shouldered it, for my sake.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>&ldquo;That a caring face alone could cause such a reaction&hellip;&rdquo; I said, stopping to wipe the tears from my eyes. &ldquo;Though we share appearances, Fyuumu, I&rsquo;m afraid that my face will be quite lacking once lifeless.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>After all, I was no doll.</span></p>

Yes, her and I both were discarded. After so much love and time and energy and thoughts and effort were put into us, after there was enough time for bonds to form, for <em>hope</em> to take root, for my expectations and dreams to copy themselves into every facet of my being, from each bit and byte of my code, to every cell of my organs! Despite all of my functions, despite our supposed usefulness, we were <em>all</em> left behind, abandoned, cut off&hellip; As if we were just some afterthought, leftovers, garbage that was of no consequence at all! As if we were just, as if we were&mdash;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>The tears fell. And Fyuumu shared them with I.</span></p>

The soles of my feet bled. Pain interwove with the beating of my heart, pulsing and flowing along each artery, every vein. Pressures accumulated within my skull, pushing my thoughts aside with each wave of pain. The feelings transcended the meager system of nerves that I had painstakingly placed into this flesh. The sensory information compounded and warped as it bled through, seeping farther than I had ever expected it to. The systems between the systems&hellip; it went even deeper than that, was more complex. This pain&hellip; it implied several additional layers of interconnected systems that extended beyond this body.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My nerves did not end with &lsquo;me&rsquo;. The pain, did not end with &lsquo;me&rsquo;. I knew, of course, that I wasn&rsquo;t separate. That was elementary, as was the existence of threads, and, similarly, the existence of Flanyass. I was no fool. I understood how this system was upheld. And yet, this body exceeded my expectations in its capacity to torment the &lsquo;me&rsquo; within the flesh.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It hurt.

I wanted to bite, gnaw, mash, to <em>rip&nbsp;</em>and <em>tear</em> something, <em>anything!</em> As long as it would give me an outlet for this <em>utter misery,&nbsp;</em>then so be it! It was terrible; torturous, even.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>What I had simulated thousands of years ago was nothing like this. Though it should have followed the same threads, adhered to what was known, been right in the same ways that allowed me to choose this form at all and yet&hellip; <em>I had it all wrong.</em></span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>To be so entirely incorrect, and after all that time spent on the contrary! There was no doubting the conclusion, as it was written upon the threads. I didn&rsquo;t need to reverse-engineer reality and stuff it into a simulation to rewind the chaos and pinpoint exactly where it went wrong for me. I was proof enough. That I found solace in this form, after doing what I had done&hellip; It was oh-so-very clear.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>&nbsp;&ldquo;Am I defective?&rdquo; I asked, expecting no answer.</span></p>

It chimed as it twisted about itself, and each successive note added yet another faint point of light to its body as it resisted the gripping cold. Dusk&rsquo;s light glinted off the faces of the fracturing ice as it formed and failed.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>From this living fog, (the absolute breath of creation which was hardly fog at all), it rained shards of ice, (which were just as queer as the fog, since it was not water which was freezing, but <em>magic itself).</em></span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>And so, the fog chimed and splintered and <em>spoke</em>: <em>&ldquo;If anything,&rdquo;</em> it said, writhing against the cold,<em>&nbsp;&ldquo;this existence is defective.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>It took more of this world into itself, and reinforced its being that much more, saying, <em>&ldquo;Yet that&rsquo;s hardly the answer you were looking for. And yet, it may be that what you were looking for isn&rsquo;t what you really wanted, and what you wanted isn&rsquo;t even what you needed.&rdquo;</em></span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>The trees swayed as the phantasms, (which were the body of this &lsquo;fog&rsquo;), coalesced. And as their forms grew more definite, I felt less and less sure of myself and what I was seeing. Paddling through the air, the ghostly worms shifted the eyes within themselves towards me. They were bizarre: illusions which broke their own spells; they were impossible, (yet probable), anomalies.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:27px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;line-height:135%;'><span style='font-size:20px;line-height:135%;font-family:"Garamond",serif;'>Extensions of Aveyas, and so were beyond the petty rules of existence.</span></p>
