To increase suffering, the old container production units were disposed of and recycled into base materials for the original auto forges to create the first generation of box production units. Before this change, the BPF was named the “Container Production Facility” or CPF for short. In conjunction with this change of production, the facility was renamed. For after this point, (once the BENEFACTORS had arrived in Terminal 230), the wide variety of containers produced at this facility were reduced to a single “box” shape. 
<br><br>
(Originally, there were cylindrical containers, spherical containers, and some pyramid shaped containers, to name a few. As previously stated, changing production to only accommodate boxes was done solely to increase overall suffering within the facility.)
<br><br>
The drastic shift in production caused a huge spike of suffering to everyone involved. There was no way to cover orders for containers, because, of course, up until this point, everything had not been box shaped. There was exponentially high demand, but no way to meet it. Every customer had to be convinced to order things in boxes. Box production still had to be worked out, how to store boxes was still a mystery, and so on and so forth. 
<br><br>
Everyone was forced to work until they bled to death. Weaponry was employed at random intervals, and to varying degrees. There was a planned, and controlled outbreak of worms, which may or may not have been modified to explode when agitated. 
<br><br>
Suffering was not only ensured: it was made plentiful.
<br><br>
So, in this way, the bed of suffering was made fit for the “sowing” of the very first grief seeds. After the initial spike of suffering had died down, the choice to exclusively produce boxes began to show its true potential. It was only boxes. Every day. Forever. It was the same shape. Going down the same machines, getting filled the same way, and being shipped off as a box.
<br><br>
Box, box, box…
<br><br>
Boxes, as the BENEFACTORS had said, would be the perfect shape to increase suffering, by way of monotony. And this was absolutely true. Their insights into this shape proved to be extremely useful, and extremely profitable. Using their combined intellect, the BENEFACTORS were able to provide certain guidelines outlining how best to restrict box configurations to increase suffering, while also increasing box capacity.
<br><br>
This, and other suffering advances allowed the crash of suffering output, (which started once production stabilized and orders had been reconfigured), to return to nearly its utmost height during the spike.
<br><br>
Thus, the grief seeds were able to be grown successfully, and before the BPF had been established for an extended period of time. This is how the BPF was able to exponentially grow its suffering output. That surge of suffering was key towards propelling the grief seed operations into overdrive. Without it, it was projected that it might take another 50 cycles to reach the point at which the BPF was at only 3 cycles into its life!
<br><br>
This plan was, of course, led by the BENFACTORS. After all, they were the only ones who had access to the original grief seeds. These seeds are, of course, not of Terminal origin. They come from outside the Terminals, same as the BENEFACTORS. 
<br><br>
Where that exactly is, however, is not clear. 
<br><br>
Still, the grief seeds allow for an abundance of energies to be harvested and sent to the surrounding Terminals. This is an irreplaceable asset in our plight to open the Gate. For this purpose, Terminal 230 was ready and willing to be sacrificed. 
<br><br>
Of course, some entities have to be unwilling for the required suffering to be created, and thus provide sufficient nutrients to grow the grief seeds in the first place.
<br><br>
This is acceptable. 
<br><br>
That concludes the refresher on the beginnings of the BPF.
<br><br>
Additionally, there are plans to allow probes into the BPF to increase suffering. If future workers could be grown, it has been proposed that they could be modified to suffer when in proximity to probes. Anxiety, stress, pain… the “whole package”. It is said that it’s already a trait amongst some workers to find suffering in being watched by others while working. However, probes are uncaring. They are not a part of the BPF. They aren’t there to assist in box production, nor are they there to reduce suffering, even if the suffering is evident.
<br><br>
In this way, by allowing access to the BPF to outside forces, (such as probes), we can introduce something that “could” do something, but will do nothing instead; or, at the very least, it will probe around and pick away at the BPF for knowledge, ultimately leaving the workers behind to suffer just as before they had arrived.
<br><br>
The suffering department is working to make this dream a reality.
