<p>&ldquo;THEY SEEM PRETTY POWERFUL. IF THEY AREN&rsquo;T RELICS, THEN THEY WILL BE EVENTUALLY.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ANALYSIS OF COMMENT BY +F.V.49:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I DON&rsquo;T WANT TO AGREE, BUT I DO.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> RELAYING RELEVANT DATA NOW&hellip;</p>
<p><br /> <br /> Unknown? Relic?: [??Shadows??]</p>
<p><br /> (It is unclear if this is actually a relic, though it certainly could be.)</p>
<p><br /> Through unknown means, subject [Svoyoss] was able to command and manipulate &ldquo;shadows&rdquo;. Though immaterial, these shadows were able to interact with the material world, and it seems that there were things able to harm them despite their immaterial forms. <br /> <br /> Because of their form and characteristics, these &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; were able to slip through normally impenetrable objects with ease. Their physical strength could also be quite high when masses of &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; were used in tandem. The exacts on how much force one &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; could apply is not known, nor is it known how one lone &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; would look like when separated, (or if it even can be separated from other &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; at all). With this having been said, records repeatedly indicate that a mass of shadows, roughly half the size of an adult &ldquo;human&rdquo;, can break all of the bones of said adult &ldquo;human&rdquo; with a single blow. Although, this is merely an aftereffect of the attack literally crushing the entire body. Even without enveloping the physical entity, the shadows can spread throughout the point of attack and constrict the insides in the instant that the attack lands with smaller projections of its mass.<br /> <br /> COMMENT BY 86C2A:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I WONDER IF SVOYOSS IS IN CONTROL OF THE SPECIFICS OF THE ATTACK OR NOT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COMMENT BY +F.V.49:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SEEMS ODDLY SPECIFIC FOR DISPATCHING A WEAK BEING. MOSTLY WATER. LOTS OF BLOOD, NOT A LOT OF TEETH.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br /> Records also show that they were able to amplify the effects of some relics, such as the [Perspicacious Confluence]. Additionally, the shadows were able to form links between themselves and relay information back to [Svoyoss]. With this method of extending, the &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; were able to extend the effective range of the [Perspicacious Confluence]. Records indicate that this placed additional strain upon [Svoyoss], and the strain&rsquo;s intensity was directly influenced by the duration of the amplification / the additional distance covered. One more than one occasion, this method caused the subject&rsquo;s heart to stop completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also theorized that these &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; were some sort of energy, or force. Although, it has been noted in other records that other &ldquo;shadows&rdquo;, namely those not utilized by [Svoyoss], were able to move of their own accord and make decisions. Despite the sparse sightings, all &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; which were not related to [Svoyoss] all seemed to move in large masses, keeping to the farthest depths and avoiding contact with anything that was not another &ldquo;shadow&rdquo;. This suggests that though they consist of either unknown matter or energy, they exhibit some qualities of being &ldquo;alive&rdquo;.<br /> <br /> COMMENT BY 86C2A:<br /> &ldquo;I WAS NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM OR DENY IF THESE &lsquo;SHADOWS&rsquo; NEED TO EAT.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br /> <br /> Modified Relic: [Arms of Diminishing]</p>
<p>This relic started out as a large bone of some unknown creature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COMMENT BY CCCCCCC7:</p>
<p>&ldquo;UNKNOWN, YET UNDOUBTEDLY A GOD OF SOME SORT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is extremely dense and has extreme durability which is not explained by its base elements. Despite being hit with forces that should damage it, the relic shows no sign of strain nor suffers damage. It is impervious to temperature extremes, and not even the shock of rapidly being subjected to one extreme and then another can reduce its durability. <br /> <br /> However, the relic [Threadbane] was able to carve into the original bone. With this being said, perhaps there are other relics that can damage this bone, but base means are completely ineffective. Regarding [Threadbane], and its ability to damage the bone: [Threadbane] was used as a tool to shape the bone, (over the course of several years), into armor to be worn upon a human&rsquo;s arms.<br /> <br /> COMMENT BY CCCCCCC7:</p>
<p>&ldquo;IT APPEARS DANGEROUS. FOR ARMOR, THAT IS.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br /> COMMENT BY +F.V.49:</p>
<p>&ldquo;WELL, IT IS.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br /> Aside from its durability, there is yet another aspect of this relic which the subject [Svoyoss] sought it out for / added to the time needed to carve it out into something which could be worn: there is an aura around this bone which drains all manner of energy. <br /> <br /> In &ldquo;human&rdquo; terms, there is a spherical area emanating from the center of the bone, (once broken into separate pieces, they possess the same radius, regardless of how small the broken piece becomes), and that spherical area is exactly six meters across. The closer to the center of this influence, the faster energy is drained from the area. As previously stated, when pieces are broken up the radius is unchanged; however, what does change is the rate at which energy is drained from the given sphere of influence. The smaller the piece, the weaker its drain is. Further probing reveals that if broken pieces are brought together, they strengthen each other&rsquo;s aura to the point where if all pieces were brought together they would equal the strength of the original aura before the entire bone was broken up.<br /> <br /> A &ldquo;human&rdquo; standing at the very edge of this aura would start to feel weak immediately, (light-headedness, nausea, loss of muscle strength, excessive sweating, uncontrollable tears, vertigo, and a distinct loss of body heat would ensue), but if they were healthy they could &ldquo;possibly&rdquo; remain there for two hours without passing out. (If a &ldquo;human&rdquo; were to pass out at the edge and remain there, then they would surely die due to the loss of body heat.) <br /> <br /> If a particularly stupid &ldquo;human&rdquo; were to stand at the half-way point of this aura, they &ldquo;might&rdquo; be able to withstand the strain for approximately thirty minutes. The effects of the half-way point are said to be: &ldquo;Along with the effects already mentioned: a sharp decline in sight, along with a fogginess of the mind. Bones will gradually weaken, becoming soft and prone to fractures even whilst standing still. Permanent blindness may occur. Additionally, blood vessels will begin to rupture after prolonged exposure.&rdquo; This can cause sudden death, but certainly can kill even those who get out of the aura, due to the ensuing internal bleeding.<br /> <br /> Getting closer still, if a &ldquo;human&rdquo; were to simply walk up to the bone and touch it, (without having been in the aura at all before taking this walk to the bone), then they would have anywhere from ten to thirty seconds before their insides are turned into a so-called &ldquo;slush&rdquo;. There are several other effects caused by being so close, but the important takeaway is that unprotected lifeforms will succumb rapidly to all of these at once, resulting in nothing more than a pile of mush.<br /> <br /> Only protected lifeforms, those with adequate relic protection, will be able to appreciate the many effects of getting that close. Subject [Svoyoss] mentions these effects in a passage referring to getting this close with only meager protection.</p>
<p>EXCERPT:<br /> <br /> &nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Upon arriving at the accursed bone itself with only a half-measure, one quickly realizes that they would have been better off with no protection at all. Those who have &lsquo;volunteered&rsquo; to make that terrible, grueling walk into the relic&rsquo;s aura all shared the same fate, regardless of the additional protections each one carried. <br /> <br /> For each advancement made, it only prolonged their inevitable deaths when meeting face to face with that curious bone. Each was worse than the last. I heard every scream, read every thought. Unless the threshold was somehow met, my efforts only lengthened the most ruinous effects, stretching out the transformation into a gelatinous pool of regret.<br /> <br /> A truer relic, perhaps, could resist it&hellip;&rdquo;</em><br /> <br /> Since this aura does not &ldquo;completely&rdquo; drain energy from any given point, it does not entirely wipe things from being able to &ldquo;be&rdquo;. Instead, it reduces the total amount of energy allowed to exist in its radius. In regards to life, this is a complete dead zone incapable of supporting life. With this having been said, it normally would be impossible for the subject [Svoyoss] to utilize such a relic, even once it was shaped into a useful form. The key to its utilization is the addition of the relic [Scintillating Myriad]. With this, [Svoyoss] is able to eliminate the effects of the drain upon his own being and assorted relics.<br /> <br /> COMMENT BY +F.V.49:</p>
<p>&ldquo;IF THE SCINTILLATING MYRIAD WERE TO BE DISABLED, OR IF A SIGNICANT PERCENTAGE OF ITS COVERAGE FAILED, THIS RELIC WOULD SURELY KILL [SVOYOSS].&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;AND YET, [SVOYOSS] UTILIZED IT WITHOUT THIS OCCURING.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COMMENT BY CCCCCCC7:</p>
<p>&ldquo;THIS IS TRUE. ALTHOUGH, THERE ARE SEVERAL PIECES OF DATA THAT SUGGEST THAT THE SUBJECT WAS NOT DESTROYED IN THIS MANNER.

IT IS JUST A LESS INCOMPLETE SHARD, AFTER ALL.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COMMENT BY +F.V.49:</p>
<p>&ldquo;REGRETTABLLY, THAT IS TRUE. BUT STILL, KEEP YOUR SPECULATIONS IN CHECK. THE [SHARD OF EXTRICATION] WAS NOT ATTUNED TO THE SUBJECT IN THE SAME WAY AS THESE OTHER SHARDS WERE.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br /> Cursed Relic: [Perspicacious Confluence]</p>
<p>This relic has the appearance of a &ldquo;helm&rdquo;. It has been shaped out of some sort of quasi-metallic material, but upon further inquiry it is not metal at all. Instead, it is a composite material of several differing layers of unknown origin. With the right tools, one can see that these rather unworkable materials have been interwoven to differing degrees. How these metal-esque materials were turned into threads at all is unknown. Although, the resulting combination results in a moderately sturdy design which possesses a rather &ldquo;unique&rdquo; sheen. Light hitting its surface causes a bizarre &ldquo;aurora&rdquo; pattern to appear upon this relic.<br /> <br /> Though its composition is unique, [Perspicacious Confluence] derives its namesake from its other qualities. When fitted over a &ldquo;head&rdquo;, (most likely only one with a brain inside), the relic bolsters all aspects of the mind. Some examples would be enhanced mental clarity, memory recall, and critical thinking. Aside from this effect, [Perspicacious Confluence] also allows the user to sense the intentions and thoughts of those nearby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subject [Svoyoss] has also written that [Perspicacious Confluence] protects against the mental degradation, strains, and mind-manipulations encountered when delving into the so-called &ldquo;Abyss&rdquo;. Without such a relic to reduce said strains upon those who enter this &ldquo;Abyss&rdquo;, they are likely to be &ldquo;consumed&rdquo;. It is implied that this is not a preferable outcome, and translating the text [Svoyoss] left has given a rough estimate of resisting these &ldquo;strains&rdquo; without a relic: approximately less than 0.1%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COMMENT BY 86C2A:</p>
<p>&ldquo;HOW WAS [SVOYOSS] ABLE TO RETRIEVE THIS FROM THE ABYSS IN THE FIRST PLACE?&rdquo;</p>
<p>COMMENT BY +F.V.49:</p>
<p>&ldquo;RECORDS INDICATE THAT [SVOYOSS] ATTRIBUTED AN &lsquo;&hellip;UNNATRUALLY STRONG WILL, WITH AN ACCOPANYING ALL-CONSUMING DESIRE, COMBINED WITH AN UNBELIEVABLE STRING OF GREAT FORTUNES AND FORTUITOUS EVENTS&rsquo; AS THE ONLY REASON THAT THERE IS EVEN THAT LESS THAN 0.1% CHANCE OF ESCAPING AT ALL.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br /> Lastly, if the user dies while wearing the [Perspicacious Confluence], &ldquo;something&rdquo; happens. [Svoyoss] alluded to it in the recovered texts, but the specifics are vague. With this having been said, there may be even more to this relic than previously thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cursed Relic: [Threadbane]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not much is known about this particular relic. It is an irregularly shaped stone that is 8.25 inches long, and can cut anything. Even lightly holding it will cut the user. This is strange, since the stone does not seem to have any particularly sharp edges upon analysis of all archived information.<br /> <br /> The subject [Svoyoss] was able to wield this relic due to the &ldquo;shadows&rdquo;. By proxy, they were cut and re-melded themselves to undo damages while letting other shadows be cut and keep this relic still. With this method, the relic could be used as a makeshift &ldquo;dagger&rdquo;. <br /> <br /> Although, if handled without care, this relic would induce a response from nearby shards. In relation to [Svoyoss], this would relate to the relic [Scintillating Myriad]. Since [Threadbane] is so volatile, cutting even the threads around itself, shards will respond defensively far earlier than one may think. This could cause destruction to anything nearby, as the shards react violently to this relic.<br /> </p>
<p>Illustrious Relic: [Scintillating Myriad]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not one exact relic, but a collection of relics. Namely, a collection of &ldquo;shards&rdquo;. And this collection, in particular, shares the same characteristics with more complete shards despite the fact that all shards included under the name [Scintillating Myriad] are very small. Normally, shards of this size would be rather ineffective, finding it difficult to muster up the strength to simultaneously move themselves and extend their influence; however, [Svoyoss] found a use for them. By embedding them within his body, he was able to combine and centralize their power right where their defenses were needed the most.<br /> <br /> It is theorized that by embedding them within a &ldquo;host&rdquo;, these shards eventually attuned themselves to the host body&rsquo;s life signatures. Over time, perhaps, they would come to recognize this pattern as their own. This may explain why [Scintillating Myriad] seems to proactively protect even the relics worn by [Svoyoss], even though they are not necessarily part of his body. It could be that they are able to sense their importance in keeping [Svoyoss] alive, and do not immediately destroy these aberrant objects despite their apparent danger to the subject.</p>
<p><br /> This recognition of a new whole may also explain why [Scintillating Myriad] is able to act more as a unit, rather than each shard lashing out on its own. Building off of this, it could be reasoned that the relic&rsquo;s name is not referring to the shards in particular, but the unity between them.<br /> <br /> In case one could not infer the capabilities of such reduced shards, (since they are joined into a unison of sorts), they are unable to manifest the ruinous light. Additionally, they do not grant [Svoyoss] with the ability to take flight. Instead, this collection of shards is highly sensitive to direct threats upon its host body. Upon sensing an incoming projectile from some primitive weapon, or a collapsing wall which was neglected for too long, the shards project their force in the opposite direction, acting to keep the threat away from ending [Svoyoss].<br /> <br /> The strength of these unseen projections, however, always end up being extreme. As long as something large enough comes along and is poised to do harm, seemingly once the motions have been set into the threads by fate, then the shards act. Even the sad projectile known as an &ldquo;arrow&rdquo; will be met by enough force to topple a fully grown &ldquo;tree&rdquo;. This protection has caused more destruction than can be put into words. And though it has kept [Svoyoss] safe, it does not show any care for allies.<br /> <br /> However, through many efforts, the [Scintillating Myriad] eventually learned to hold back on its defensive reaction if the danger could not penetrate other relics used by [Svoyoss]. One notable example of this is the [Arms of Diminishing]. Most threats lost the necessary energy required to do harm before reaching the subject, resulting in a more than 50% reduction in violent &ldquo;shard&rdquo; reactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obscure Relic: [Arcane Strands]</p>
<p>Meticulously locked within several sets of increasingly complicated boxes with similarly complicated locks, is a small, specially crafted bottle. Within this, is the relic known as the [Arcane Strands]. Whilst contained in its bottle, the relic seems to be more of a haze rather than strands. The cause of this is currently unknown, but it is speculated that when subjected to its own magics within a confined space, it changes its state of matter. Prior test show that the temperature and pressures within the bottle do not change while the [Arcane Strands] alter themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When taken out of its bottle, the relic radiates a peculiar light, and coalesces into the strands that are its namesake. However, it also radiates more than simple light. As seen on several occasions, exposure to the [Arcane Strands] in its strand-like state will burn the skin or carapace of anything which is touched by its light. Corpses are not immune to this relic&rsquo;s trait, and even creatures who are undeterred by high heat sources will be burned regardless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although it takes some time to be burned well enough to sustain lasting damage, such as severe scarring, the light from this strand phase can easily blind if left unchecked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from these interesting traits, this relic also gives off a slime while it assumes its shape of countless strands. This slime, while exuded in scant quantities and requiring much care to scrape off of the strands safely, is of some worth. While its properties have not been fully studied, subject [Svoyoss] was able to concentrate this slime over a period of a year to create a &lsquo;lure&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What he lured, and exactly how, he did not say.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Illustrious Relic: [Shard of Extrication]</p>
<p>Similar to [Scintillating Myriad], this relic is a &ldquo;shard&rdquo;. It measures 4 meters high, and at its widest is 1 meter wide. It is not known how [Svoyoss] was able to obtain such a large shard, nor how he facilitates communication between himself and this shard. Though this shard is meager when considering archival information on the largest of their kind, the [Shard of Extrication], when considering its size and power, was rare in the time of [Svoyoss]. The original shards, at that point, had been either destroyed or shattered into smaller pieces. As per recovered data, the vast majority of &ldquo;shards&rdquo; were even smaller than the individual pieces that, as a whole, made the [Scintillating Myriad].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COMMENT BY CCCCCCC7:</p>
<p>&ldquo;IT IS STRANGE THAT THE SUBJECT WAS ABLE TO PROCURE SO MANY OF THESE &lsquo;LARGE&rsquo; SHARDS DURING THIS TIME. ALSO, WHEN CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF RELICS POSSESSED BY THE SUBJECT, I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A MISSING EXPLANATION TO THIS END RESULT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COMMENT BY 86C2A:</p>
<p>&ldquo;AGREED. THOUGH &lsquo;SMALL&rsquo; IN COMPARISON, IN CONTEXT THESE WERE ALL EXTREMELY SCARCE RELICS. FAR LARGER THAN WHAT WAS &lsquo;COMMON&rsquo; GIVEN ALL KNOWN RECORDS. MORE DATA IS REQUIRED.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br /> Being that it is a complete shard, (especially one that can support its own weight and resist the forces of falling), it is able to project much more force than its smaller counterparts can. Although, its relatively smaller form means that it cannot project this force for nearly as long as the greatest of shards could have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of its value being increased mainly by the scarcity of others of its kind, it is still able to replicate the ruinous light. With this, it has wonderful offensive capabilities. It has been theorized that a prolonged burst of this light could damage the [Arms of Diminishing], or even destroy it entirely. Unfortunately, [Svoyoss] did not record any information as to whether this was attempted as a test or not.<br /> <br /> The [Shard of Extrication] derives its name by working together to unearth secrets and relics alike with [Svoyoss]. The specifics of this relationship are unknown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parasite Relic: [Thread Intuition]<br /> <br /> There is little information on this &ldquo;relic&rdquo;. In truth, it seems less of a relic and more of a very useful parasite. Although, with its effect taken into account, it could easily reach relic status when applied to current models.<br /> <br /> When this parasite latches onto an eye, it will consume and replace it. If the host is strong enough to keep the parasite sustained, then it will become an &ldquo;organ&rdquo; capable of directly detecting the threads themselves. To give its host this ability, it directly links itself to the host&rsquo;s brain using the connections the original eye had.<br /> <br /> The full list of effects upon the host when parasitized by this &ldquo;relic&rdquo; is not known. What little has been discerned is that the host&rsquo;s new &ldquo;eye&rdquo; is highly sensitive to all &ldquo;natural&rdquo; light. [Svoyoss] seemingly coped with this effect by utilizing an item known as an &ldquo;eyepatch&rdquo;. (It is not known if the &ldquo;eyepatch&rdquo; hindered the parasite&rsquo;s ability to see threads or not.) Additionally, the parasite links itself to the circulatory system of its host and leeches nutrients to sustain itself. This draws a great deal of energy from the host, and has left the subject [Svoyoss] crawling on the floor in delirium at times.<br /> <br /> However, based upon recovered texts, it is postulated that the parasite reduces its drain once it has the necessary energy to reproduce. This coincides with the onset of episodes of acute pain and weakness that afflicted [Svoyoss].<br /> <br /> An estimate of this reproductive cycle suggests that once a year, the parasite will subject the host to several unpleasantries.<br /> <br /> <br /> Woven Relic: [Sealed Space]<br /> <br /> Created by subject [Sen]. Relic has the appearance of a cloak, but somehow the fabric has had a &ldquo;closed off space&rdquo; linked to it. The specifics of the base materials of this relic, and the exacts on how this space operates, is unknown. Both [Sen] and [Svoyoss] have been seen both placing objects into, (and removing objects from), this relic that they wear about themselves. <br /> <br /> With this relic, they are able to carry several key items with them at all times, without having to rely on others to carry it for them. This is useful when dealing with dangerous and valuable relics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blessed Relic: [Shallc]<br /> <br /> This relic is a pendant, which [Svoyoss] always wore. It seems that the pendant itself was carved out of a piece of bone. This, however, was not the bone of something interesting, such as bone that constitutes the [Arms of Diminishing]; instead, the bone was once part of a &ldquo;human&rdquo; skeleton. And so, it possesses no notable physical qualities.<br /> <br /> Despite its plain appearances, [Svoyoss] wrote that the pendant had, among other things, healing properties:<br /> <br /> <em>&ldquo;Shallc, I still see you in my dreams. Even now, I can hear your voice. As always, you tell me to smile, to stop worrying so much&hellip; And, yes, you want to be picked up and held: forever and always. Ah, always wishing to see the world from the tops of my shoulders&hellip; That&rsquo;s you.<br /> <br /> Though you are no longer able to sit on these shoulders of mine, I still hold you each and every day. You are never beyond my sight. And I am never without your warmth: that which pains beyond reason, negates all nerves, and, yet, heals besides. In the suffocating dark, you are my guiding light.<br /> <br /> A blessing I never deserved.&rdquo;<br /> </em><br /> COMMENT BY +F.V.49:</p>
<p>&ldquo;IT ALSO SEEMS THAT THIS RELIC POSSESSES THE ABILITY TO &lsquo;GUIDE&rsquo; [SVOYOSS]. YET THE ONLY SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR THIS IS THE TEXT THAT THE SUBJECT WROTE DOWN. MORE DATA IS REQUIRED.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> [Svoyoss] always sleeps with this relic close to himself. Usually, he falls asleep with this pendant in his grasp. It could be that this is a prerequisite for its &ldquo;guidance&rdquo;, but this is merely conjecture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cursed Relic: [Writhing Morass]<br /> <br /> [Svoyoss] has sealed this relic off. As such, there is almost no information on it. From watching how [Svoyoss] reacts around the area where it is sealed off, (deep within the &ldquo;Extricating Church&rdquo;), it can be inferred that it isn&rsquo;t good. At least, not to the subject.<br /> <br /> Unlike other troubling relics, this one has not been subjected to repeated attempts to understand it more deeply&hellip; hence the lack of information. What is known, however, is the name given to it by [Svoyoss] whilst &lsquo;writing&rsquo;. The text with this particular information is the only archived information pertaining to this relic, and so it will be relayed below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Though I comprehend its importance, it is only on the basest of planes. And no matter the truth, it is abhorrent. A potent, living, breathing curse. This writhing morass, fertile and teeming&hellip; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>What was sealed away in that tomb was not for me to see.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /> Undetermined Relic: [Invisible Puzzle]<br /> <br /> Supposedly, it&rsquo;s a relic. Though it&rsquo;s hard to say if it&rsquo;s real or not, since only [Svoyoss] has seen it. Where it supposedly is, nothing can be detected. [Svoyoss] keeps it on a pedestal in his personal room; he often spends time interacting with it, and briefly mentions this activity in one passage, writing, <br /> <br /> <em>&ldquo;It is confounding and compounding all at once. It anticipates my movements before I have even been made aware of my own intent. It responds, churns, and twists about itself in overlapping flows; and still, it is not complete. This puzzle has yet to fully unravel. And what it has completely revealed to me, (so far), is the absolute maddening ingenuity of its makers.<br /> <br /> This is no mere puzzle, though I refer to it as such. It is not keeping idle, and it is keeping me out: akin to a lock. Yet that is not the whole of it. To say that this relic is perspicacious would be a certain mistake; the word cannot penetrate the depths of its intelligence. Even with the Perspicacious Confluence at my disposal, as I bring every facet of wit to duel with this puzzle, it confounds me all the same.<br /> <br /> Yes, this &lsquo;puzzle&rsquo; is testing me. To discern its entirety requires that I can prove my worth. And by its jittering, undulating complexities, it hints at something that is worth all of this effort. Though, it won&rsquo;t tell me what. Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t.<br /> <br /> Until I can force it to acknowledge me, it will continue to pick apart my mind and tease and pry, all the while leaving me with an overabundance of &lsquo;why?&rsquo;.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /> Undetermined Relic: [Crescent Casket]<br /> <br /> A strange casket, and possibly a relic. It measures about 20 meters at its longest length, yet is surprisingly light for its large size. It has been built into an odd crescent shape. Upon analysis, it seems that it was constructed from some sort of plant material. [Svoyoss] described it as, <em>&ldquo;&hellip;possessing all the qualities of wood, yet distinctly not from any tree known to man.&rdquo; </em>But unlike wood, this material resists fire. In fact, it seems to actively extinguish it as if it were wet with some liquid. Though there isn&rsquo;t any such liquid upon its surface&hellip;<br /> <br /> When this relic is left closed, a faint scratching sound can be heard emanating from within. Yet, when opened, it is revealed that there is nothing inside. Aside from this strangeness, if one climbs into the casket, they will feel extremely warm. And, if that same entity were to close to the door whilst still laying within the casket, then they will feel a fleshy substance embrace them. This, is also &ldquo;warming&rdquo;.<br /> <br /> The relic does no visible harm, and seemingly only warms those inside of itself. When they emerge, however, they will find themselves covered in a slimy coating. What purpose this substance serves is currently unknown. <br /> <br /> COMMENT BY 86C2A:</p>

<p><br /> <br /> Undetermined Relic: [Reticent Bell]<br /> <br /> This relic seems to be a &ldquo;bell&rdquo; of some sort. It was not made by &ldquo;humans&rdquo;, and has the appearance of a spiraled shell. Whatever created this relic, did so with consummate skill; it is adorned with spirals upon the spiral of its main body, and within these additional spirals are spirals engraved within these. Even the air around it, spirals. (90% of all who saw its form found it appealing. This is even with probes added into this statistic, and they don&rsquo;t find a whole lot appealing.) One common comment given when looking at it is: &ldquo;I want to protect it.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> (Perhaps, if more of these [Reticent Bell] relics could be brought together, their effect upon the air would be amplified. Or, even worse, their appeal could go up.)<br /> <br /> When shook, this relic does make a sound, but it is not what one may expect. Or, in another way, it may be exactly what you&rsquo;d expect. This &ldquo;bell&rdquo; does &ldquo;chime&rdquo;, but the sound itself cannot be heard by those who it &ldquo;does not know&rdquo;. &nbsp;Upon shaking the bell and releasing this &ldquo;chime&rdquo;, its &ldquo;sound&rdquo;, (though mainly unheard), leaves a &ldquo;spiraled&rdquo; distortion upon all other sounds in the vicinity. The louder the chime, the more pronounced the effect. The why, or how, is unknown. <br /> <br /> The other notable aspect about this relic is that, at times, it &ldquo;speaks&rdquo;. This has been theorized to be a projected hallucination into those nearby, since the sound does not emanate from the shell itself as does its &ldquo;bell&rdquo; chime. [Svoyoss] has attempted to have others hear its voice, but it did not speak to those it &ldquo;did not know well enough&rdquo;. At least, this is what [Svoyoss] said.<br /> <br /> Though it does not speak very often, and seems to only speak to an entity that listens to it for an extended period of time, it will refuse to chime if it has not &ldquo;spoken&rdquo; to anyone within a set number of weeks. According to [Svoyoss], the [Reticent Bell] will begin to &ldquo;weep&rdquo; if it is not interacted with. What would actually happen, is unknown, as this is information the subject was able to gleam from speaking with the relic.<br /> <br /> On an unimportant note, it seems to &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo; being &ldquo;pet&rdquo;. Somehow, its &ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo; makes its surface glow with a blood-like hue. Rarely, when being touched, it will also &ldquo;sing&rdquo;. What this exactly means is known only to the [Reticent Bell] and [Svoyoss], as this sound is only transmitted through the previously discussed unknown method.</p>

<p>Undetermined, Clarifying Relic: [Unknown Unknown Unknown]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Echoes of a conversation held between [Svoyoss] and [???] suggest that this relic exists. There are several similarly unknown relics that possess not enough information to be mentioned, but this relic in particular, though scarce on information, seems to be of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scraped together data suggests that this relic is able to see, &ldquo;&hellip;as the gods do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>COMMENT BY 86C2A:</p>
<p>&ldquo;THE ONLY THING THAT COULD SEE AS THEY DO, WOULD BE THEY THEMSELVES. THIS LEADS ME TO HYPOTHESIZE THAT PERHAPS THIS RELIC IS AN ACTUAL EYE OF ONE SUCH BEING.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COMMENT BY +F.V.49:</p>
<p>&ldquo;THIS HYPOTHESIS HOLDS MERIT. THE [ARMS OF DIMINISHING] ARE ONE SUCH EXAMPLE OF THE CORPSES OF GODS BECOMING RELICS. IF EVEN A FRAGMENT OF A BONE COULD IMPART SUCH POWER, THEN SURELY AN EYE, OF ALL THINGS, WOULD BE EXCEPTIONALLY POTENT.&rdquo;</p>
