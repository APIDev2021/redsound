Greetings, this is Angus typing.<br><br>
		  
Truthfully, I don't get asked lots of questions, and most of the questions that are asked are really stupid ones... <br><br>
<LI>

		  
<img draggable="false" src="images/uu6611.gif"><LI><br><br>

...like so.<br><br>

With that being said, I'm going to be simplifying this page. Maybe if I get more cool / real ones, I might add more information here. But until then, this is all I will offer up.

<ul>
      <LI>
      <font color="#d2738a" size="4">
“What is the purpose of this website?”
</font>
<br><br>

<font color="#c1b492" size="4">
Firstly, <font color="#d2738a" size="4">"angusnicneven.com"</font> is my author website; I require such a thing to further my writing ambitions. Secondly, I'm just built different.<br><br>

<font color="#d2738a" size="4">
“That doesn’t really clear everything up though…”
</font><br><br>

<font color="#c1b492" size="4">
That’s fine.
<br><br>
	<font color="#d2738a" size="4">
“What's the lore behind X, what's the meaning behind Y?”
</font><br><br>

<font color="#c1b492" size="4">
Thankfully, a lot of these things can be answered by what I've created so far. So, even if I die soon, a lot can be cleared up by delving into my CONTENT.<br><br>
...but you'll have to find the answers for yourself. I know, "reading?", "puzzles?", "exploration?", and in the current year???<br><br>
I feel you. But, I had to BUILD it.

<ul>
      <LI>
      <font color="#d2738a" size="4">
“What was your inspiration for the site?”</font>
<br><br>

<font color="#c1b492" size="4">
One day I happened to exist. Pretty strange.
<br><br>
(Also, buy my book(s). Share my shit. Tell everyone I smoked crack with aliens to make this WACKY site, or whatever you have to say to them to get them to check it out.)<br><br>
Please, I've put so much time into this and I have little to show for it but a few schizos stalking me online now.<br><br>

 <font color="#d2738a" size="4">
“Can you explain your inspirations more than that, please?”
</font><br><br>
	<font color="#c1b492" size="4">
No. Most people just don't "get it" anyway. <br><br>
Truthfully? If you don't feel existential dread when you look up at the night sky, then you wouldn't get it either.
		</font><br><br>
 <font color="#d2738a" size="4">
“Wait, did you say you have books?”
</font><br><br>
	<font color="#c1b492" size="4">
One right now, but maybe when you read this I'll have 2. Maybe not. <br>
But the thing is, no one asked this question.<br><br>
Yeah, that's right, I'm trying to get you to read MY book. Shameless, I know. But, I think the book is cool, and if you're unsure, check out the FREE chapters I have on THIS SITE, or there's a small portion for free on amazon itself...

“How did you make your images look so cool / How did you apply this/that effect to your images?”
</font>
<br><br>

<font color="#c1b492" size="4">
I use a computer.<br><br>
You might be able to get more answers out of me if you pay me money.<br><br>
But I don't think many people actually care about how to make this shit, (mostly, anyhow), and they just want to find <font color="#d2738a" size="4">"THE END."</font>
<br><br>
(No one asked, but there's over 3,000 images on the site as of now.)
