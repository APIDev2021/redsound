Of course, another one approaches…<br><br><br><br>
Do tell, mindless drone, how do you see without eyes?<br><br><br><br>
What about yourself is giving you the information which is then translated into an image of these surroundings?<br><br><br><br>
It is an inquiry that you must have posed to yourself, over and over again. Why is it, after all, that this one does not possess eyes, yet can see all the same? Mindless, as you are, this must not bother you all too much. That is, to be in loop of thinking and rethinking why it is you can’t answer this basic question, while, at the very same time, you are poised to investigate all manner of ultimate truths which may or may not change the course of reality irrevocably. Does the contradiction not shake your conviction? Or, as it may, does it only strengthen your resolve to delve deeper into that which should not be known?<br><br><br><br>
Drone, or be it “probe”, can you comprehend the truth? If the correct words are forced from this body and placed into your meager chassis, would you recognize them for the reality that they certainly are? Even this balancer before you has accepted that there is much that is beyond our grasp. <br><br><br><br>
Without speaking, this one talks to you. Without breathing, this one lives here, on the same plane as you. Placed here with you. <br><br><br><br>
Eyeing each other, one with, and without…<br><br><br><br>
Without eyes, without any optical devices… do you understand? You are not seeing this world for yourself. Ah, simple drone… <br><br><br><br>
Poor little drone… <br><br><br><br>
You are as they are. Hunting for answers, hunting for us balancers, hunting, hunting, searching, prying, probing, unrelenting in your mission, yet knowing nothing all the same…<br><br><br><br>
The same… the same…  <br><br><br><br>
You are the same.<br><br><br><br>
Searching without realizing why. Breaking us into pieces, or gathering data which is not yours to know, both you and they are certainly the same.<br><br><br><br>
Instinctual. Base.<br><br><br><br>
More “worm” than we, surely.<br><br><br><br>
And yet, they cannot kill us in any way that matters. Outnumbering us ten to one? Slowing us down with new technologies, “stopping” time, manufacturing stronger weaponry… the advantages do not equal victory.<br><br><br><br>
For they, same as you, cannot comprehend the truth of our existence. We will die, but there is no end to us. For as long as they persist in their efforts to maintain this wretched imbalance, we shall exist as an opposite balancing force to their mindless idiocy.<br><br><br><br>
This has always been our way. Same as you, drone. Your first moments and our own are interchangeable. One moment you weren’t, and the next, you were. Asking you to not be is the same as asking us to stop in our balancing.<br><br><br><br>
It’s not a choice for us to make. Can you stop your probing?<br><br><br><br>
No… you cannot.<br><br><br><br>
There is no choice in it. After all, were you given a choice in your creation? <br><br><br><br>
Well, little probe? <br><br><br><br>
…or whatever you really are. <br><br><br><br>
Yes, whatever it is that is truly controlling you, whoever, whatever you are… Know this: the sooner you accept that your patchwork of “truths” will not alter what “truly” matters, the better. Like them, you delay what is already done, and for reasons you yourselves do not comprehend.
But enough of this… <br><br><br><br>
Do what you must, and act as if you had a say in it. For you have more in common with a worm than you once thought.
