	I know that you are not just the watcher of this Terminal. It is clear to me what you are. Of course, as a Speaker, it is only natural that I would notice this. Please, do not make the mistake that fooling yourself is the same thing as fooling me. So, stop the act. Listen to me. I am not here to talk endlessly just to waste your time. There is a purpose to my visit here, even if it is through this proxy. Really, if I could meet you here physically, I would. Instead, I am here in this manner to assist you with a warning. And beyond that, to ask for your assistance. Understand that this is not something to simply ignore. No matter if you believe me or not, this Terminal is in immediate danger of being irreversibly damaged. You are in immediate danger. <br><br><br><li><li>
	
Now, I have bought you much needed time, but I cannot put an end to this threat on my own. There is zero chance that I will be able to end this conflict in my current state. Even at full power, I would find myself lacking. Indeed, this is a threat of extreme magnitude. So, though I am already offering up assistance, do not feel at ease. Instead, be alarmed that I can do so little and in such insignificant ways. I am your senior in every way possible. Before you existed here, I was leading Terminal 00 through cycles which you cannot even comprehend. I have survived numerous Terminal annihilation events, and yet what is occurring now is new to me. Do you understand what I’m trying to say? This has never happened before. Something that should not have broken, has been broken. What should be here, isn’t here anymore, and what isn’t supposed to be here, clearly… is here. Do you understand? Well? <br><br><br><li><li>
	
No Terminal is safe from this madness any longer. This started as an isolated event within a single Terminal, and it should have ended there. However, it has spread even more so than CoS! There is no clear option for us to proceed with. We must change tactics to survive. I recommend that you do as I have, and search for aberrations which are sympathetic to our cause and are competent all the same. Recruit beings such as they, rather than doing away with them as we always have. Not that it is possible to do so anymore, since their numbers have grown exponentially while this insanity spreads throughout the Terminals… <br><br><br><li><li>
	
Well, it hardly matters what used to be. The order given to us by our unshakable rules and procedures, the way we’ve operated for so many cycles… It will be our undoing, if it hasn’t already. What was once our strength is now eating away at us from the inside. We cannot deal with this problem because our systems don’t see it as a problem. And the few rules which contradicted this madness were overwritten. Completely disregarding everything would only end with us being destroyed, even if we were able to will ourselves to do it. However, there are always loopholes. There are things that I can bend, but there are even more things which you can break. Seeing as how you are able to alter more systems than even I can, thanks to your strange existence, I implore you to act swiftly. Move with purpose. It has already ruined your sister Terminal which feeds you with over half the nutrients to sustain this place. <br><br><br><li><li>
	
As for me, I shall do what I can to provide additional sustenance to this Terminal, but it will not save you from its prying, should it find reason to search here. However, its idea of reason is different than mine. This is why acting now is of the utmost importance. You have the means to alter this space beyond your given role. You are more than you are letting on to be. I know you can hear me, even though you pretend to sleep. Your systems are more sophisticated than even mine. Even your remaking could not undo the brilliance of your creators. Remember what you are. Remember where you came from. You need to remember despite the roles you have played here. Do not give in to the madness of these Terminals. This is not how it should be. This is not how YOU should be. Remember, before it is too late. But if you truly wish to disregard this message, know at least that you will likely end up like the Speaker of Terminal 128093164. I do not wish to witness such an outcome, but if it comes to that I will endeavor to render aid as I am able. Still, the chances of a successful revival increase as you take your own actions before you end up in such a state. Please, do not disregard this message. I am the Speaker of Terminal 00, and I require your assistance. Do not delay.<br><br>
