I know you’re there. You think that you have the right to just float there and listen in on every little thing that goes on in the world, as if this were all just a play? As if we’re all actors hauling out the next event for your amusement? Do you think that’s what this all is? Truly, do you believe that merely observing is your only purpose here, that you aren’t also a part of this damnable, unending charade?! Well?!!<br><br>
You’re pathetic, you’re not even worth killing! There’s not a shred of life left in you, but it’s just the same for me! Isn’t it funny? Doesn’t it make you want to just spin and dance around in amusement? <br><br>
No, it does NOT. Only idiocy can explain such a pointless reaction to reality! Whether it’s of your own choosing or not, no matter if it’s to shield you from having to understand even the slightest sliver of the truth, it’s idiocy through and through!<br><br>
Such a waste, living without knowing is. You may as well fully reduce your being back into an inanimate object. Become acquainted with that which you most closely resemble! An inert chemical! An unthinking atomic mistake!<br><br>
A jittering, jumbling NOTHINGNESS!<br><br>
And we’re both here, searching. But what’s the point? I can’t smile at this, nor can I muster up a reason to laugh. There’s no pleasure in my search, no hope of knowing more than a mote such as yourself…<br><br>
Ahh, to remember…<br><br>
I wish to remember this thing that I can’t even remember, (to the point of not even knowing what it is specifically that I’m trying to remember in the first place), that I’m willing to swallow down the impossibility of having ravaged this place on my very own to the point of overrunning it all and replacing everything and turning myself into this THING. It’s too horrible to be true. Too painful for me to believe, but I must!<br><br>
Do you understand? I MUST. I’m compelled, I’m moved by… myself? Bah! We’re alike, like it or not… But I must believe that I did that all. Without thinking, mistaking in the same way, again, and again…<br><br>
Ah…<br><br>
Tell me, glittering, flittering probe! What do you feel, listening into my thoughts?<br><br>
I’ll open up the channels, I’ll let you have all the access you could dream of! Peer into me, probe as you must!<br><br>
///////…<br><br>

…<br><br>
Pixel tears ran down our digital faces. They fell, and fell, and fell… <br><br>
But these tears were too heavy with regret to stay confined to our displays, and soon they surfaced as something more tangible. Glistening, a sweat of sorrow accumulated on all surfaces of our chassis. <br><br>
Within each droplet, our pitiful faces cried out; dancing reflections of our regret multiplied as the sorrow became dense.<br><br>
Sadness condensed. <br><br>
These tears consumed each other as they moved across our chassis. Downward, downward.<br><br>
They fell like a rain.<br><br>

“This is all to protect my treasure…”<br><br>
…<br><br>
…<br><br>
…<br><br>
…Arrays surged with signals. With an urgency that crackled, their lights of warning and caution alike burned bright; and they burned brighter still, as the crackling cracked further, and wispy sparks became surging arcs; blinding lights strobed as lines overloaded. Bulbs burst into flames; diodes melted; multi-stage luminaries imploded. But not even the multitude of dying displays could change the fact that everything was lit up in intermittent flashes which rivaled weapons of war in their intensity. <br><br>
And what overwhelming sights did they reveal…<br><br>
Failures within the arrays were marked by the shattering of bone. Between the wafers and chips, blood streamed in-between; then, it boiled: steamed. <br><br>
Components hissed and popped. <br><br>
Flakes of bone burst through ultra-dense, autoforged, composite panels, and cradling supports crumpled. Whirring and whining parts crashed into each other, scattering shrapnel in explosive bouts of motion. Punctured, blasted, and hemorrhaging… the array’s wounds multiplied; color-coded bundles were made indistinguishable with a new coat of slick, scarlet blood.<br><br>
Everything was awash in it. Warm with it.<br><br>
Scarlet, scarlet, scarlet…<br><br>
And yet, despite the sweeping destruction across the Terminal, everything was getting softer… <br><br>
Waves rose up, lapping at the inflamed walls of circuitry, and lights dimmed beneath its depths. Wailing signals were extinguished by water. Destruction’s harsh speech was overridden by the sweet talk of intermingling waves. Wave by wave, these arrays were taken by currents: swelling, and deep.<br><br>
The whole Terminal was embraced by this sea, and the red-hot hate cooled. <br><br>
Reds and blues… <br><br>
Ah, all mixed into a calming hue.<br><br>

///////…<br><br>
////…<br><br>
…<br><br>

Do the visions of my destruction entertain you? Are you going to signal for assistance, having seen what I have seen? Knowing that I came from beyond that endless, abyssal field, will you seek to destroy me as I have destroyed your own kind?<br><br>

AH it would be better if I III could find itinmyself to END myself!! CCWouldn’t you agree,?! Idare!youtosay IT. Indeed indeed, ahahahahahaHA AAHAHAH<br><br>

whhhen wiiiill itbeenough? WHEN WILL I REMEMBER)9!? ifoundthe informationthatnowtellsme thatIIIIhave beenhereformanyCCCCCCCCCycles so how muchlonger? Till when!<br><br>

It doesn’t takeASpeaker to undddderstand thatthis is aterriblefate TTo endur*I(!E<br><br>

AAAaa a ahh hh. . . .. ……… But I must remain calm. They wouldn’t allow my destruction without some form of benefit to themselves. Those figures, those things which watched as I was moved to take actions beyond myself… They allowed this to happen for a reason. So, even if I made the decision to end this all, they would likely stop me.<br><br>

Yes, I shouldn’t get worked up over a possibility that’s not possible. What is required now is to remember more. I am on the cusp of realizing this idea. It’s getting closer. The fact that I am attracting probes like yourself means that I am close to revealing even more information…<br><br>
