-This is an archived and condensed version of the [REDACTED] report. -<br><br>


(The number of this report has been redacted to keep current reviewers and reporters honest and to dissuade them from skipping over “irrelevant reports”. Sorry for the inconvenience.)<br><br>

Since the last report, the failing tiles have not been fixed. <br><br>

Efforts have been made to improve the singing capabilities of all workers. Good job on the effort, but the results are still in need of improvements. A long-wave harmonizer is proposed to assist in these efforts. One can be ordered from the attached catalogue. 
<br><br>
During the current visit, several puddles of blood were found within the areas surrounding the BPF. It is recommended that more patrols should be issued to watch for spontaneous box destruction events. It is recommended that blood spills be cleaned up as soon as possible to reduce the risk of attracting pests.
<br><br>
A non-slip coating along the walls in the hallways is recommended. 
<br><br>
The filters on the air intake units are, once again, missing. An investigation into this strange occurrence is recommended, as well as replacing these air filters as soon as possible.
<br><br>
All chemical vats have improved since the last visit. Leaks have been fixed, and damages have been mitigated. Good work.
<br><br>
The lights in sector 405-Bh have been flickering since the [REDACTED] was turned on. It is recommended that this be fixed as SOON AS POSSIBLE. Flickering lights can reduce [REDACTED] production by creating a “soothing” effect in the area, if the flickering gets to a certain frequency. Please address this issue soon.
<br><br>
It was recommended during the last “23” visits that additional PPE be worn by workers stationed nearby the dismantling area. However, this level of safety has been ignored to increase [REDACTED] levels. It’s also possible to use PPE to increase survivability while also increasing the ever important [REDACTED] levels. This can be discussed at any time.
<br><br>
There are abnormal signals originating from several points outside the BPF. It’s recommended that these be investigated whenever convenient.
<br><br>
We worked with the [REDACTED] to improve [REDACTED] levels in [REDACTED]. Please speak with [REDACTED] to learn more information.
