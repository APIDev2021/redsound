I’m leaving my notes here for anyone else who dares to try and pass this barrier. But don’t get your hopes up just yet, I’m missing something, even after getting so far. The missing data could be anything, if my line of thinking even is right, and if it’s not right, then… I have no idea what the solution could be.



You see, there’s a certain barrier I’ve detected in this area. Now, it isn’t always the case, but, usually, this sort of barrier builds off of the area before it to strengthen itself. Out of all of the areas it could be drawing its strength from, this one has the strongest lingering frequencies passing through. They resemble the barrier I have in mind.

So, I propose that it’s possible that the first part of the code you’d need to get to this next area is this area’s designation. Yep, the one way up above you. That’s the one. 

After several years of trial and error, I came across a message in Terminal 440235584899582730518450218405 which, seems to me, to be referring to this barrier here. Long story short, the next part of the code, which would add onto what we currently have, is a “_” symbol. That could have been guessed, but they could have inserted any sort of joining character, so it’s a big help to know this information.

Now, this is where my efforts have largely failed.

There’s some sort of interference with even these faint wavelengths and frequencies which propagate from this point in space, (the propagations of this hypothetical barrier, that is). By simulating what could possibly be interfering with these signals, I have worked out some sort of garbled text… several sets of garbled texts, actually. I’ve narrowed the vast array of possible sets to only a handful of likely candidates, but it’s still not ideal to have so many without having any clue about how to pick them apart. Or… even what to do with a “correct” set of garbled text.

And there might even be multiple correct sets… and then, what do we do with that?

Well, that’s all I have at this time. I’m going on a journey, and I’ll be thinking about this as I travel through the Terminals.
